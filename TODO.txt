BUGS:
* still some issues with shadow
* can't reconstruct the sign of the ZAxis part of the normal right now
* transparent sprites dose not align with uneven sprite offset
	- [-maybe create two versions ???-]
	- make transparency not part buffered sprite, instead make it a shader/material

TODO:
* Editor
	- Undo/Redo
	- add/remove Voxel
	- ColorSelector
	- ViewingModes
	- EditModes
	- copy/paste
	- animation
* give sprites an material how select witch shaders should be used for rendering to screen
* [-Offset for Sprites and Shadow-]
* introduce fix raster (maybe 9x9x9) to get proper shadow
	- the LightDirection main (longest) axis value has to be this raster size (9)
* shortcut Shadow calculation while using NormalLayer
	- make it optional for translucent ???
		- part of the material

DONE:
* Upscale Patterns
* view from bottom
* deep offset buffers for voxel
* non cubic "Blocks"
* HotReload for AppLogic
* HotReload for EngineCode
* Shadow Layer
* Layer
* Mouse position improvements
* Normal + Shading

NOTES:
* Cube Colors:
	- 7Bits: 5 x 5 x 5 = 125 Colors + Non + PrimaryColor??? + SecondaryColor???  (Two Team or Effects Colors???)
	- 1Bit: 50% Transparent (draw only every second pixel)
		- or primary or secondary materials ???
