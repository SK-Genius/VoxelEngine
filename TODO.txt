BUGS:
	* can't reconstruct the sign of the ZAxis part of the normal right now
	* transparent sprites dose not align with uneven sprite offset
		- [-maybe create two versions ???-]
		- make transparency not part of buffered sprite, instead make it a shader/material
	* shadow edges show artifacts on the edges some times. maybe an off-by-one bug
	* changing windows size can end in crash (canvas size?)

BUGS IN EDITOR:
	* the 3D position of the mouse pointer includes the preview objects unintentional
		- [-do i have to draw the scene ones for the mouse and ones for the screen? or-]
		- draw in different canvas (base on interact with the mouse or not) and compose it later
	* the second point for an rect selection is off

TODO:
	* give sprites an material how select witch shaders should be used for rendering to screen
	* shortcut Shadow calculation while using NormalLayer
		- make it optional for translucent ???
			- part of the material
	* create render a pipeline
	* SIMD support
	* Editor
		- Undo/Redo
		- ColorSelector
		- ViewingModes
		- EditModes
		- copy/paste
		- animation
	* maybe improve shadow by higher resolution

DONE:
	* introduce fix raster (maybe 9x9x9) to get proper shadow
		- the LightDirection main (longest) axis value has to be this raster size (9)
	* Upscale Patterns
	* view from bottom
	* deep offset buffers for voxel
	* non cubic "Blocks"
	* HotReload for AppLogic
	* HotReload for EngineCode
	* Shadow Layer
	* Layer
	* Mouse position improvements
	* Normal + Shading
	* Editor
		- add/remove Voxel
		
NOTES:
	* Cube Colors:
		- 7Bits: 5 x 5 x 5 = 125 Colors + Non + PrimaryColor??? + SecondaryColor???  (Two Team or Effects Colors???)
		- 1Bit: 50% Transparent (draw only every second pixel)
			- or primary or secondary materials ???
		- or 1Bit: for cluster (subtree is all the same material)
